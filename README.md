# Roguelike Font Preview App

This is a simple page using a mock-up of a roguelike map to showcase various fonts.
Those fonts were all found on [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and were bundled using [FontSquirrel](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/).

The roguelike display was made using [rot.js](https://ondras.github.io/rot.js/hp/).
